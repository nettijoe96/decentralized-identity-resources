## primitives


## precursors

### PGP: pretty good privacy
1. OpenPGP ([link](https://www.openpgp.org/)): open source version of PGP
2. key servers ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/GnuPG/comments/ix2gdj/what_pgp_key_server_to_use/)): searchable public keys
3. key signing party:
    1. 

### decentralized DNS
1. Namecoin ([whitepaper](https://www.namecoin.org/resources/whitepaper))
2. Stacks ([docs](https://docs.stacks.co/docs/build-apps/references/bns))

### governance
1. quadratic voting ([paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2003531))

### CAPTCHA: Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart
1. original paper ([paper](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-39200-9_18.pdf))
2. Idena FLIP ([medium](https://medium.com/idena/ai-resistant-captchas-are-they-really-possible-760ac5065bae)): Human-generated CAPTCHA. The theory is that it is easier for AIs to complete generated CAPTCHAs than human-generated CAPTCHAs.

## projects
1. HumanityDAO ([medium](https://github.com/marbleprotocol/humanity), [github](https://github.com/marbleprotocol/humanity)): Verfication though DAO members voting on social media links and bio. Identity rejection forfeits user's stake. Only incentive to vote honestly is maintaining the future growth DAO (Cartel problem).
